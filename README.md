3 Days Kickstart Challenge ðŸš€

This challenge marks the beginning of my serious journey to become job-ready as a web dev developer. Over 3 focused days, I tackled key html,css and js basics to reset my mindset and build daily coding discipline.

ðŸ’¡ Why I Did This
After years stuck in tutorial hell, I committed to a no-fluff, code-first learning path. This mini challenge was my first step toward long-term consistency and self-growth.

ðŸ“… Daily Breakdown
Day 1: Solved 3 easy level js-hero problems, created a project using html, css and js (vanilla navbar + modal).
Day 2: Solved 3 easy level edabit problems and 6 extra easy level extra edabit problems and modified the project by adding a form in the modal.
Day 3: Solved 3 8-Kyu codewars and finished the final project. Updated the from to be frontend functional with js validation and background overlay.

Rewired my foundation in html, css and js
Created a daily coding habit
Prepared to take on more advanced challenges

ðŸ§  This is part of my roadmap to become job-ready by December 2025.
